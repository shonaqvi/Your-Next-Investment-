One of the world’s biggest problems is a way to solve the Climate Crisis and Clean Energy.

One way to impact in the daily live is to change our mind set to sustainable sources. Sustainable investing is an active pursuit to invest in areas and companies that are developing new technologies to solve the world’s biggest challenges. It takes environment, social, and corporate governances’ matter into consideration looking to pursuit a sustainable future encouraging everyone to participate in spurring economic growth for all, reducing inequality, improving ways of doing business, and securing environmental sustainability for generations to come.

To help investors, we created a Presentation of the study of case about EV Market and its Leader: TESLA. Please check the file **TSLA deck.pptx** under Slide_Template folder.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly common, on the global scale. China is the country with the most electric cars, with nearly 1.8 million overall! But when we account for the country’s population, it is Norway that comes in first. In U.S, pure electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrids account for less than 2 percent of U.S. light vehicle sales currently, there has been increasing interest from car shoppers.

Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. EVs generates no particulate or smog-causing tailpipe emissions, which are a significant contributing factor in causing asthma and other air pollution-related illnesses. EVs have lower carbon emissions than gasoline powered vehicles over their service life. To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy products that enable homeowners, businesses, and utilities to produce and manage renewable energy generation, storage and consumption. Homeowners can install solar panels or Solar Roof to power their home using 100% renewable energy and store that energy in Powerwall, which makes electricity available during peak energy-use periods to help them save money and provides power during grid outages.

But it is not a faire tale, as an investor, you should first consider Tesla’s debt story and the automotive industry background. Through history, only one auto manufacturer in the United States has never gone bankrupt—Ford (F). Yet almost did in 2008.

Auto manufacturers need massive amounts of capital to invest into the actual manufacturing process. Tesla had to fuel its expansion by leveraging debt. The company's debt ballooned, exploding from $598 million in 2013 to nearly $10 billion in 2018. It ended 2018 with a total of $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
The only way to fund this position is through ever-increasing share-equity or long-term debt raises. But it can lead in either diluting the earnings per share (EPS) value for stockholders or weigh down the company with debt to equity in a ratio that will continue to outpace its major competitors. The capital structure of Tesla appears to be in trouble for investors. It must continue to grow its top-line revenue significantly to be able to provide confidence to its investors, lenders, and shareholders, while at the same time increasing its return on equity, return on assets, and profit margins. Tesla has now been profitable for four straight quarters for the first time in company history — an elusive benchmark the company has long sought. It help out the company to generate $6 billion in revenue, buoyed by $370 million in energy storage sales and $487 million in services revenue.

As an investor, if you have added tesla stock in your portfolio and hold, it would have returned a great value into it over 2020. If you researched about Tesla fundamental as a company, also true believe in EVs and renewable energy and how much it can grow over time you would be a winner as investor. Tesla proved to be a low risk-high return stock. For more information about Tesla stock you can check a nice python codes with graphs as follow under code(python) folder:
* **TESLAvsSP500.ipynb**: Tesla performance over the last 5 yeas comparing with S&P 500 index;
* **TESLAvsAutomakers**.ipynb: Tesla performance over the last 5 yeas comparing with the industry leaders;
* **Return.ipynb**: We got 4 of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 index of the last 5 years and showed its performance through a portfolio of equals wight, also we did a simulation looking this portfolio performance for the next 5, 10 and 20. Then, we added Tesla stock into this portfolio and did a simulation again. Check out the results and be surprised of the value that Tesla could return to your wealth.

In conclusion, Tesla has successfully entered in the Chinese EV market, which is the largest auto market, now the country is about to become an even more critical part of its global strategy due the fact that Tesla plans to export their Chinese-made vehicles to Europe. Although, it’s may be temporally given that the company is building a Gigafactory in Germany. Tesla is the largest seller of EVs in China and has, besides the increasing in competitors, plans to keep being the number one as the demand in the country increases, as well. In The U.S, the new president Biden plans to renew and fund more tax credits for consumers who buy electric vehicles, it could help manufacturers. Also, Biden is more likely to levy tougher emissions rules on the gas-burning vehicles. Additionally be aware of that Tesla isn't just a car company it's getting 15% of its revenues from energy generation and storage, and services. We can assume that the future can be bright to Tesla sales and profits from cars and his portfolio of new technologies.
